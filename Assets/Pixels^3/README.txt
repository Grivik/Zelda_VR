Pixels^3: This Shader, Pixels^3(Cubed)!

Substance: A Substance is what Allegorithmic calls their generated material packages. You know them as "Materials" in Unity!

Substance File: The file that holds all of your generated materials. Its icon should be a piece of paper with a red "flame" on it.
	-NOTE: You can click the small triangle to the right of the Substance File to show all the materials generated by it!

Grid: The pattern overlayed on top of your supplied texture.

Base Texture: This is the texture that you assign, that you`ll see under the grid.
	
///////////////
Basic Use Guide
///////////////

	To use Pixels^3 in Unity, follow these simple steps.
	
1. Select the "Pixels^3" Substance file in the project window, in the "Pixels^3" folder. Now at the top of the Inspector window, you can create new materials, copy existing ones, and 
delete ones that are no longer needed.

2. At this point, you can start using all the features and settings to create a texture! Click the small "+" at the top of the inspector window to create new default materials as needed.
	-NOTE: You can also duplicate the Substance file entirely to seperate your materials into groups! For example, you could have all your grass materials together, all your stones together, etc.
	-NOTE: Check out the Features Overview section below to learn about what all the settings do!
	
3. After you have created a material and set it up to your liking, you can assign it to your GameObject. You can do this by either selecting the GameObject and assigning the material through
its "Mesh Renderer" component, or you can click the small arrow next to the Substance file to expose all the created Materials, and drag one directly onto your GameObject in the "Scene" window.

FAQ and Troubleshooting
///////////////////////

-----General/Performance-----

Q: Does Pixels^3 only work on cube models? 
A: Nope! Check out the included grenade GameObject examples under "Examples/Prefabs"!

Q: Can you create unique materials without creating a texture for the "Texture Input"?
A: Absolutely! Check out the block examples under "Examples/Prefabs"! Some of them, like the gold bars block, were created entirely in Pixels^3!
	-NOTE: You will always need at least a blank white texture assigned in the "Texture Input," so that you can apply colors. There is a blank texture included under "Examples/Textures"!

Q: How can I edit the Material`s settings?
A: Just select the Material file in the "Pixels^3" folder, and you can edit the settings in the "Inspector" window!

Q: Where are all the custom settings?
A: After you have a material selected, scroll down a bit, and all the settings will be located under a heading labelled "Procedural Properties"

Q: The Material is updating really slowly, or not updating at all in the Editor!
A: You probably need to lower the Material`s output size, at the bottom of the Material`s settings.
	-NOTE: After you edit the settings, you can crank the Material`s output size back up!
	
Q: The Material looks really blurry, or is not showing correctly in the Editor!
A: You probably need to raise the Material`s output size, at the bottom of the Material`s settings.
	-NOTE: To edit the Material`s settings, it`s highly recommended to lower the output size first, as it may update slowly!

Q: My material is all black!
A: Even if you`re not using a texture, you`ll still need to assign a blank white texture to the "Texture Input".
	-NOTE: There is a blank texture included under "Examples/Textures"!

Q: My question wasn`t answered!
A: For bugs/issues that cannot be resolved with this readme, please contact us at support@paletteconcepts.com, with the subject line "Pixels^3".

-----Grids-----

Q: The grid`s not lining up perfectly on my non-cube GameObject!
A: This all comes down to how well your model was UV mapped, and where the UV seams are. A good model will have it`s UV seams hidden in a place where the player is less likely to notice them.
Just like any regular material, it is unlikely to match up at the UV`s seams!
	-NOTE: Also try adjusting the grids offset and rotation under the "Grids" section!
	
Q: My grid looks all warped and distorted!
A: Just like the previous question, this also comes down to how well your model was UV mapped. If you didn`t make your model, try contacting the artist who did!
	-NOTE: Pixels^3 works great with most of the built-in Unity 3D primitives!

Q: Do I have to use a grid?
A: Nope! Just toggle the "Show Grid" option!

Q: I can`t see the grid at higher tile values!
A: This is usually due to a low material resolution, try changing the resolution to a higher setting at the bottom of the Material`s settings.

Q: The "Smart Grid" turns my material into a solid color!
A: The "Smart Grid" option works best with a higher contrast, simpler image. Whenever a material is turned all one color, that`s actually the grids lines being either very dense, or very
thick! Make sure to play with the different settings in the "Texture" and "Smart Grid" sections to try and get a better result!
	-NOTE: Check out the "Smart Grid Example" material to see it in action!

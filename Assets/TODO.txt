--- TODO ---

BUGS:

* BUG: Raft - There are holes that Link falls through at start/end tiles of Dungeon 4 Raft crossing.
* BUG: Enemies can push Link upwards
* BUG: Dungeon 8 is visible from inside grotto to the south of it.

- BUG: Keese in sub dungeons can move through stairs
- BUG: A Ghini somehow survived the death of its master (possibly spawned right as master died?)
- BUG: Enemies that spawn after clock has activated aren't paralyzed
- BUG: UI Views can get clipped if you are close to a wall (maybe use ImageEffects->ScreenOverlay?)
- BUG: If you have no ItemB equipped, and you collect an Active item, it correctly equips; however when subsequently viewing Inventory, the cursor has not been updated
- BUG: If you buy Red potion (instead of HeartContainer in special grotto) you can obtain the letter simply by using the red and blue potions.

- BUG: Unity crashed unexpectedly shortly after returning to OW after completing Dungeon 1
- BUG: ZeldaVRSettings values dont persist when closing UnityEditor


High Priority: 

* Test: Bosses
* When warping, ensure that world has completely loaded before opening shutters
* World fall-through fail-safe 
* Water Tiles: Currently Sword and Wand Projectiles can't pass over water;
	Link can walk on water (try lowering his step offset only while on stairs?)

- CandleFlame: If hits Burnable/Enemy, it should spawn directly on top of Burnable/Enemy.
- Arrow: Graphic doesn't appear next to bow in inventory, even when you have both bow and arrow items

- Blue Wizzrobe: Should not teleport
- Peahat: Can fly through blocks, and sometimes gets "bounced" forcefully across the world when colliding with a block
- Boulders: Should bounce around
- Statues: Enemies can walk through them

- OptionsMenu: Controls

- There should be a sound and gradual heart refill when using potion
- There should be a wizzrobe sound

Low Priority:

- Building: Don't Copy meta files or backups (only copy NewGame.txt and NewGameEntryData.txt)
- Lost Woods: Overriding directions doesn't work right for -x and -z;
- Beams from many dungeon enemies should be unblockable (Is this too difficult though?)
- Is it possible to "double collect" a Collectible by throwing the Boomerang and then walking into item as Bomerang returns?
- Dungeon tunnels have passages with zero-thickness walls
- Old men in dungeons don't fight me back
- Whistle Warp: Facing north or west, warp to the next dungeon; facing south or east, warp to the previous dungeon
- Whistle Warp: If he blows the Recorder multiple times while the whirlwind approaches, he can cycle through the sequence indefinitely. 
- Texture blocks correctly (use BoxMesh.cs?)
- Texture OW DungeonEntrances correctly?
- Hold up HeartContainer if received in Grotto
- LikeLike: Show an effect to indicate what's happening when player is trapped ("swallowed")
- ImageEffects on camera (bloom etc)?
- SoundFX DSP (ie. reverb in dungeons)
- Music Fade In/Out
- Trees and rocks are shorter than a full tile
- Consider having dark rooms show walls dimly like the original
- Being able to aim arrows upward is a nice touch, but it's annoying when I shoot the ground, so maybe downward arrows should instead go parallel to the ground, like beam sword or wand. 
- Increase maxLiveProjectiles for certain bosses?
- What's up with Manhandla projectiles/damage?
- Have Enemy's pushBack force applied in weapon's moveDirection. (Have all weapons/projectiles transform.forward point in their direction of travel.)

- Leevers: Should not be harmful when burrowing 
- River Zora projectile should briefly hold position (~0.3 secs) before firing towards Link

OPTIMIZATIONS:

NEEDS TESTING:

- LikeLike MagicShield stealing


RESEARCH:

- Fairy: Changes move direction regularly (is this how fairy is supposed to move?)
- Boomerang: Should it hurt stunned enemies?
- Letter: Should it still appear in inventory after its been used (assuming no potions in inventory)?
- Sealed Doors: If sealed door is opened, then player dies, does he have to kill all enemies again to reopen it or does it stay opened?

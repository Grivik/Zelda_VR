Weapons:

- Adjust enemy health (x4) and increase all weapons dmg, then eliminate the Enemy versions of weapons
- Increase maxLiveProjectiles for certain bosses?
- What's up with Manhandla projectiles/damage?
- Have Enemy's pushBack force applied in weapon's moveDirection. (Have all weapons/projectiles transform.forward point in their direction of travel.)


Voxel Engine:

- Use flat tiles at same voxel tile height as unit blocks
- Integrate Lost Woods with Uniblocks


3rd-Person Camera Mode:

- Tracked head movement should not effect Link facing direction/position

- Show Shield, indicate MagicShield?
- When WandProjectile hits Link's shield you should see it reflect off

- SoundFX DSP (ie. reverb in dungeons)
- Have enemies make some noise to alert you of their presence
- Have Statues charge up each shot with a sound effect so player knows when to dodge
- Music Fade In/Out

- Trees and rocks are shorter than a full tile
- Consider having dark rooms show walls dimly like the original
- Being able to aim arrows upward is a nice touch, but it's annoying when I shoot the ground, so maybe downward arrows should instead go parallel to the ground, like beam sword or wand. 

- Unlockable bonus Zelda remixes

- BUG: Enemies can end up walking through walls in Lost Woods

OPTIMIZATIONS:

- Spawn LostWoods only when needed

NEEDS TESTING:

- LikeLike MagicShield stealing
- Bait
- Darknut shields against MagicWand (no flame)
- Vires - No redKeese if MagicSword or magicSwordProjectile kills
- Wand Flame should light up dark room
- Sword should be able to collect Collectibles

Thought these were done already:

- Incomplete shops
- Can't buy blue potion
- Can't buy arrows anywhere, so I can't beat Gohma
- Can't find power bracelet where it should be
- When I revisit a dungeon I can collects keys and other reward items that I have already collected
- Invincible ghinis should die when the vulnerable ghini is killed

--- TODO ---

High Priority:

- Use flat tiles for ground at same voxel tile height as unit blocks?
- Grotto::DeliverLetter() -> Play Sequence with text or w/e
- Often getting stuck towards mid-top of Grotto stairs

- Cannot walk to NE corner of map ("Secret to everybody" house behind money making game)
- Having the map item doesn't mean every room in the pause map should be filled in
- Movable blocks in dungeons should be pushable from any side

- Lost Woods: Fog; Fix long load time for voxels
- Lost Hills
- Waterfall cave
- D6 OW Entrance (2 blocks wide)
- Grotto Warps

- Update Controls image
- OptionsMenu: Controls
- Ending
- Credits

- Gannon Intro
- Gannon Death


Mid Priority:

- Refactor Spells/Buffs/Effects
- Refactor Grottos

- Fog disappears abruptly in grottos close to Lost Woods
- Boss Death anim (blink 2-3 times, then "poof")
- Gleeok Heads Poof onDeath

- SavedGamesScreen - Choose Name, Elimination Mode, Name text align
- OptionsMenu: Animate to beneath inventory view on Pause_Inventory?
- "Continue or Save & Quit?" GUI

- Water Tiles: Currently Sword and Wand Projectiles can't pass over water; 
	Link can walk on water (try lowering his step offset only while on stairs?)
- If CandleFlame hits Burnable/Enemy, it should spawn directly on top of Burnable/Enemy.
- Implement a user-friendly fail-safe for world fall-through
- Difficult to use ladder to cross water
- Difficult to fire wand through narrow passages
- Fairies fly to other rooms in dungeons
- Enemies can walk through statues
- Enemies stunned by boomerang can still hurt me
- Boulders should bounce around

- Consider making the shield appear every time you deflect something
- No rolling rupee sound after "Secret to everybody" or door repair
- Hearts floating around in "Secret to everybody" cave that runs beneath fairy fountain
- Door wouldn't reopen in Level 1 old man room
- Door wouldn't reopen in Level 3 red darknut room (near where ladder is kept)
- Blue wizzrobes should not teleport
- After Ganon is hit he should be temporarily invincible so that I can't take advantage
- Dungeon tunnels have passages with zero-thickness walls

- There should be an event sound when you present meat to "Grumble, grumble"
- Need event sound in "Pick any one you want" caves
- Wrong sound effect for both types of fairies
- There should be a sound and gradual heart refill when using potion
- There should be a wizzrobe sound
- Should be event sound for riding raft
- Should be a roaring sound when in or next to a boss room


Low Priority:

- Old men in dungeons don't fight me back
- Whistle Warp: Facing north or west, warp to the next dungeon; facing south or east, warp to the previous dungeon
- Whistle Warp: If he blows the Recorder multiple times while the whirlwind approaches, he can cycle through the sequence indefinitely. 
- When warping, ensure that world has completely loaded before opening shutters
- Texture blocks correctly (use BoxMesh.cs?)
- Texture OW DungeonEntrances correctly?
- Hold up HeartContainer if received in Grotto
- LikeLike: Show an effect to indicate what's happening when player is trapped ("swallowed")
- Use sector Boundaries for OW enemies
- ImageEffects on camera (bloom etc)?
- SoundFX DSP (ie. reverb in dungeons)
- Music Fade In/Out
- Trees and rocks are shorter than a full tile
- Consider having dark rooms show walls dimly like the original
- Being able to aim arrows upward is a nice touch, but it's annoying when I shoot the ground, so maybe downward arrows should instead go parallel to the ground, like beam sword or wand. 
- Increase maxLiveProjectiles for certain bosses?
- What's up with Manhandla projectiles/damage?
- Have Enemy's pushBack force applied in weapon's moveDirection. (Have all weapons/projectiles transform.forward point in their direction of travel.)
- I'm not sure darknuts are supposed to be hurt by fire, or gleeoks by the wand
- Leevers: Should not be harmful when burrowing 
- River Zora projectile should briefly hold position (~0.3 secs) before firing towards Link
- Beams from many dungeon enemies should be unblockable (Yes, but this may be too difficult in VR)


WishList:

- Make Map display an arrow for Link instead of a square
- Place "signs" above Grottos indicating type
- Cannon Transportation for Grotto Warps
- SubDungeon Warps - Mirror effect
- Allow pushback force to send enemies flying upwards
- Show Shield, indicate MagicShield?
- When WandProjectile hits Link's shield you should see it reflect off 
- Particles for MagicSword, MagicBoomerang, SilverArrow
- Bow Crosshair
- Have enemies make some noise to alert you of their presence
- Have Statues charge up each shot with a sound effect so player knows when to dodge
- Navigatable Cheat Menu
- FlyMode Cheat

- Unlockable bonus Zelda remixes
- Unlockable Fan Art
- Unlockable Cheats


3rd-Person Camera Mode:

- Tracked head movement should not effect Link facing direction/position
- Change controls
- Decide how to move camera to follow Link
- Link Sprite
- Transition between Camera modes


BUGS:

- BUG: NewGameEntryData saving to wrong location (should be saving into ZeldaVR_Data folder)
- BUG: ZeldaVRSettings values dont persist when closing UnityEditor

- BUG: Moldorm looks crazy when resuming after pause
- BUG: Enemies that spawn after clock has activated aren't paralyzed
- BUG: Enemies can end up walking through walls in Lost Woods
- BUG: Vire can jump through wall

- BUG: UI Views can get clipped if you are close to a wall (maybe use ImageEffects->ScreenOverlay?)


OPTIMIZATIONS:

- Only update HUD text when info changes (i.e. keys, bombs, rupees, level)


NEEDS TESTING:

- LikeLike MagicShield stealing
- Darknut shields against MagicWand (no flame)
- Vires don't spawn Keese if killed by MagicSword
- Wand Flame should light up dark room

Thought these were done already:

- Incomplete shops
- Can't buy blue potion
- Can't buy arrows anywhere, so I can't beat Gohma
- Can't find power bracelet where it should be
- When I revisit a dungeon I can collects keys and other reward items that I have already collected
- Invincible ghinis should die when the vulnerable ghini is killed

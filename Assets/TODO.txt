- Unity game engine 5.3 must be version 5.3.4p5 or later.

- Maintains 90 FPS through most of the app.

- Renders head-locked UI elements such as cursors and in-game dialog in a separate layer from the main game 
	to avoid judder if the app misses frames or runs with asynchronous spacewarp. (See VR Compositor Layers.)
- Does not launch with a Unity configuration prompt.
- Displays graphics and responds to head tracking within 4 seconds of launch. Longer launch times are allowed if there is a loading indicator.

- Re-orients forward when using the reorientation option in the Universal Home menu. 
	Does not apply to apps that allow movement using the Guardian System play area.
- Exit to Home function must work.


NEEDS TESTING:

* Grottos
* Grotto_Shop: A given item should only be purchaseable once per visit to that Grotto.


BUGS:

* BUG: Enemies can push Link off the ground
* BUG: "Dynamic batching: index buffer source is NULL..." errors.  Need a permanent fix (waiting on Unity update).

- BUG: When exiting a dungeon or warping, enemies in that sector don't inititally appear (until you move far enough away)
- BUG: Dungeon 8 is initially visible from inside grotto to the south of it.
- BUG: Lanmola in D9 wasn't moving at all

- BUG: Keese in SubDungeons can move through stairs
- BUG: A Ghini somehow survived the death of its master (possibly spawned right as master died?)
- BUG: Enemies that spawn after clock has activated aren't paralyzed
- BUG: UI Views can get clipped if you are close to a wall (maybe use ImageEffects->ScreenOverlay?)
- BUG: If you have no ItemB equipped, and you collect an Active item, it correctly equips; however when subsequently viewing Inventory, the cursor has not been updated
- BUG: If you buy Red potion (instead of HeartContainer in special grotto) you can obtain the letter simply by using the red and blue potions.
- BUG: I saw Enemy Projectiles being shot through blocks (I saw an arrow and a sword near D6 OW Entrance)

- BUG: Unity crashed unexpectedly shortly after returning to OW after completing Dungeon 1
- BUG: ZeldaVRSettings values dont persist when closing UnityEditor
- BUG: If you quit and restart, Link may fall through ground (seems to only happen in Editor?) [Can't reproduce]

- BUG: If rupees are rewarded while rupee count is already taking place, then the initial rupee count stops and the remaining rupees are not received. (I think)

* Combine Invisible Collision Blocks into one single mesh per chunk
* Allow erasing of saved games, but ask for confirmation before erasing saved data
* OW Fog is too weak (GlobalFog settings)

- Grotto Warps: Destination Grotto's NPC isn't being spawned
- Grotto Warps: Blocks don't always have time to spawn after warping

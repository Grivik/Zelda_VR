High Priority:

- Use flat tiles for ground at same voxel tile height as unit blocks?
- Often getting stuck towards mid-top of Grotto stairs

- With Map:			HUD - All (except secret)	Inventory - Visited (except secret)
- W/O  Compass:		HUD - Nothing				Inventory - Nothing
- With Compass:		HUD - Triforce				Inventory - Nothing

- When warping, ensure that world has completely loaded before opening shutters
- Water Tiles: Currently Sword and Wand Projectiles can't pass over water;
	Link can walk on water (try lowering his step offset only while on stairs?)
- If CandleFlame hits Burnable/Enemy, it should spawn directly on top of Burnable/Enemy.

- Lost Woods: Fog; Overriding directions doesn't work right for -x and -z; Remove Collectibles
- Lost Hills
- Waterfall Cave
- Grotto Warps

- Gannon: Intro
- Gannon: When hit he should be temporarily invincible so that player can't take advantage
- Gannon: Death

- Don't use the same image for WoodenShield and MagicShield
- Hearts floating around in "Secret to everybody" cave that runs beneath fairy fountain
- Blue wizzrobes should not teleport
- Beams from many dungeon enemies should be unblockable

- No rolling rupee sound after "Secret to everybody" or door repair
- There should be an event sound when you present meat to "Grumble, grumble"
- Need event sound in "Pick any one you want" caves
- Wrong sound effect for both types of fairies (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhb3LqLtTBM @11:30)
- There should be a sound and gradual heart refill when using potion

- Old men in dungeons don't fight me back
- Whistle Warp: Facing north or west, warp to the next dungeon; facing south or east, warp to the previous dungeon

- Texture blocks correctly (use BoxMesh.cs?)
- Texture OW DungeonEntrances correctly?

- ImageEffects on camera (bloom etc)?
- SoundFX DSP (ie. reverb in dungeons)
- Music Fade In/Out
- Trees and rocks are shorter than a full tile
- Consider having dark rooms show walls dimly like the original
- Being able to aim arrows upward is a nice touch, but it's annoying when I shoot the ground, so maybe downward arrows should instead go parallel to the ground, like beam sword or wand. 
- Increase maxLiveProjectiles for certain bosses?
- What's up with Manhandla projectiles/damage?
- Have Enemy's pushBack force applied in weapon's moveDirection. (Have all weapons/projectiles transform.forward point in their direction of travel.)
- I'm not sure darknuts are supposed to be hurt by fire, or gleeoks by the wand
- Leevers: Should not be harmful when burrowing 
- River Zora projectile should briefly hold position (~0.3 secs) before firing towards Link
- Pushable Blocks should reset when leaving DungeonRoom (and linked doors reseal)
- HUD Dungeon Map Triforce icon should flash Red/Blue, cycling every ~0.7 secs

- Refactor Spells/Buffs/Effects

- BUG: ZeldaVRSettings values dont persist when closing UnityEditor

- BUG: Dungeon Map not displaying in Inventory
- BUG: Vire can jump through wall
- BUG: Moldorm looks crazy when resuming after pause
- BUG: Moldorm inactive

- BUG: Enemies that spawn after clock has activated aren't paralyzed
- BUG: UI Views can get clipped if you are close to a wall (maybe use ImageEffects->ScreenOverlay?)


OPTIMIZATIONS:

- Only update HUD text when info changes (i.e. keys, bombs, rupees, level)


NEEDS TESTING:

- LikeLike MagicShield stealing
- Darknut shields against MagicWand (no flame)
- Vires don't spawn Keese if killed by MagicSword
- Wand Flame should light up dark room
- Grotto: Deliver Letter

- BUG: Sometimes dungeon doors don't reopen (Level 1 old man room, Level 3 Ladder room, etc) - FIXED


RESEARCH:

- Fairy: Changes move direction regularly (is this how fairy is supposed to move?)


Thought these were done already:

- Incomplete shops
- Can't buy blue potion
- Can't buy arrows anywhere, so I can't beat Gohma
- Can't find power bracelet where it should be
- When I revisit a dungeon I can collects keys and other reward items that I have already collected
- Invincible ghinis should die when the vulnerable ghini is killed

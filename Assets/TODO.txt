NEEDS TESTING:


BUGS:

* BUG: DungeonEntrance OW: The back-most block is missing

* BUG: Sword and Wand Projectiles can't pass over water in Overworld
* BUG: Link can walk on water in Overworld
* BUG: Enemies can push Link off the ground

- BUG: When exiting a dungeon, enemies in that sector don't inititally appear (until you move far enough away)
- BUG: Dungeon 8 is initially visible from inside grotto to the south of it.
- BUG: Keese in SubDungeons can move through stairs
- BUG: A Ghini somehow survived the death of its master (possibly spawned right as master died?)
- BUG: Enemies that spawn after clock has activated aren't paralyzed
- BUG: UI Views can get clipped if you are close to a wall (maybe use ImageEffects->ScreenOverlay?)
- BUG: If you have no ItemB equipped, and you collect an Active item, it correctly equips; however when subsequently viewing Inventory, the cursor has not been updated
- BUG: If you buy Red potion (instead of HeartContainer in special grotto) you can obtain the letter simply by using the red and blue potions.
- BUG: I saw Enemy Projectiles being shot through blocks (I saw an arrow and a sword near D6 OW Entrance)

- BUG: Unity crashed unexpectedly shortly after returning to OW after completing Dungeon 1
- BUG: ZeldaVRSettings values dont persist when closing UnityEditor


High Priority: 

* Wand: Difficult to fire through narrow passages
* CandleFlame: Difficult to use in narrow passages (ie. Dungeon 8 Entrance bush) (If hits Burnable/Enemy, it should spawn directly on top of Burnable/Enemy?)

- Lost Hills: Armos don't seem to be getting destroyed correctly when reentering Lost Hills from top (after solving it)
- Waterfall Cave

- Gannon: When hit he should be temporarily invincible so that player can't take advantage
- Gannon: Death

- Dungeon: Some tunnels have passages with zero-thickness walls
- Whistle: Facing north or west, warp to the next dungeon; facing south or east, warp to the previous dungeon
- Whistle: "If he blows multiple times while the whirlwind approaches, he can cycle through the sequence indefinitely"
- Correctly texture custom blocks (ie. Grotto, Subdungeon) - use BoxMesh.cs?
- Hold up HeartContainer if received in Grotto

- Decide how to move camera to follow Link
- Link Sprite

OPTIMIZATIONS:

- Only update HUD text when info changes (i.e. keys, bombs, rupees, level)


RESEARCH:

1) Dark Rooms in Dungeons: If player enters a dark room, uses candle to light it up, exits room, and then reenters, is it dark again or does it stay lit?
2) Sealed Doors in Dungeons: If a sealed door is opened by kiling all the enemies in that room, but then player dies, does he have to kill all enemies again to reopen that sealed door or does it stay opened?
3) Darknut: Does the flame hurt him?
4) Gleeok: Does the wand hurt him?
5) Boss Projectiles: Are these generally blockable by Link's Magic Shield or not (or does it vary from boss to boss)?
6) Boomerang: Should it hurt enemies that are currently stunned by it? For example if I hit a Moblin with it once to stun him, then immediately hit him again, does this kill the Moblin?
7) Letter for Old Woman: Should it still appear in inventory after it's been used (assuming no potions in inventory)?

- Fairy: Changes move direction regularly (is this how fairy is supposed to move?)

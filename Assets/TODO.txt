--- TODO ---

BEFORE SUBMITTING TO OCULUS STORE:

- Oculus PC SDK version 1.6 or later.
- Oculus PC SDK version 1.8 or later if you use Oculus Touch.
- Unity game engine 5.3 must be version 5.3.4p5 or later.
- Unity game engine 5.4 must be version 5.4.1p1 or later.

- Maintains 90 FPS through most of the app.

* Renders head-locked UI elements such as cursors and in-game dialog in a separate layer from the main game 
	to avoid judder if the app misses frames or runs with asynchronous spacewarp. (See VR Compositor Layers.)
- Does not launch with a Unity configuration prompt.
- Displays graphics and responds to head tracking within 4 seconds of launch. Longer launch times are allowed if there is a loading indicator.

- Re-orients forward when using the reorientation option in the Universal Home menu. 
	Does not apply to apps that allow movement using the Guardian System play area.
- Exit to Home function must work.


NEEDS TESTING:

* Grottos


BUGS:

* BUG: Sword doesn't appear to move if you attack while walking, but works fine if you stand still. (this is an iTween/Rigidbody issue)
- BUG: Sword doesn't retract when it collides with a wall (it just goes through the wall)
* BUG: In VRControlMode, Sword sometimes appears below you and doesn't track with Controller

* BUG: After using whistle, the world unpauses before Link has been teleported
* BUG: Pausing while Inventory is displayed results in some Inventory graphic elements rendering in front of pause Menu (in VR HMD only?)
* BUG: UI Views can get clipped if you are close to a wall (maybe use ImageEffects->ScreenOverlay?  OR use VR Composite Layers?).
* BUG: Can briefly see through OW ground when loading
* BUG: Paralyze breaks Leevers and RiverZora.
* BUG: Leevers are vanishing after one burrow cycle
* BUG: Enemies can push Link off the ground

- BUG: If you buy Red potion (instead of HeartContainer in special grotto) you can obtain the letter simply by using the red and blue potions.
- BUG: I saw Enemy Projectiles being shot through blocks (I saw an arrow and a sword near D6 OW Entrance)
- BUG: ZeldaVRSettings values dont persist when closing UnityEditor
- BUG: A Ghini somehow survived the death of its master (possibly spawned right as master died?)

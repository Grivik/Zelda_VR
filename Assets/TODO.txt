BUGS:

- Decide how to move camera to follow Link

OPTIMIZATIONS:

- Only update HUD text when info changes (i.e. keys, bombs, rupees, level)


RESEARCH:

- Are Dark DungeonRooms supposed to go dark again when Link exits said rooms?
- I'm not sure darknuts are supposed to be hurt by fire, or gleeoks by the wand
- Fairy: Changes move direction regularly (is this how fairy is supposed to move?)
- Boomerang: Should it hurt stunned enemies?
- Letter: Should it still appear in inventory after its been used (assuming no potions in inventory)?
- Sealed Doors: If sealed door is opened, then player dies, does he have to kill all enemies again to reopen it or does it stay opened?
- "Beams from many dungeon enemies should be unblockable" (Is this too difficult though?)

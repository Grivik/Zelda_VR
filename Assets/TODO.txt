--- TODO ---

High Priority: 

* When warping, ensure that world has completely loaded before opening shutters
* Implement a user-friendly fail-safe for world fall-through
- Water Tiles: Currently Sword and Wand Projectiles can't pass over water;
	Link can walk on water (try lowering his step offset only while on stairs?)

- CandleFlame: If hits Burnable/Enemy, it should spawn directly on top of Burnable/Enemy.
- Arrow: Graphic doesn't appear next to bow in inventory, even when you have both bow and arrow items

- Enemies stunned by boomerang can still hurt me
- Blue Wizzrobe: Should not teleport
- Peahat: Can fly through blocks, and sometimes gets "bounced" forcefully across the world when colliding with a block
- Enemies can walk through statues
- Boulders: Should bounce around

- ControlsView: Update image
- OptionsMenu: Controls

- Lost Hills
- Waterfall Cave
- Grotto Warps

- Gannon: Intro
- Gannon: When hit he should be temporarily invincible so that player can't take advantage
- Gannon: Death

- Ending
- Credits

- Projectiles: Remove swift?
- Ladder: Doesn't work for certain water tiles (?)
- Dungeon: Player shouldn't be able to damage enemies if he's not all the way inside the room


Mid Priority:

- Lost Woods: Fog Ceiling color should match fog, and fade in as player approaches LostWoods
- Lost Woods: Warp Collectibles/Enemies/Projectiles
- Flat OW Blocks may be visible in Grotto/DungeonEntrance ceilings
- Fairy: Allow it to move around Dungeon Room moving outside of the room
- Fairy: Can move through walls in OW
- Clock Item: Should also paralyze enemies in nearby OW sectors (but not other DungeonRooms)
- D6 OW Entrance (2 blocks wide)
- Fog disappears abruptly in grottos close to Lost Woods
- Boss Death anim (blink 2-3 times, then "poof")
- Gleeok Heads Poof onDeath

- SavedGamesScreen - Choose Name, Elimination Mode, Name text align
- OptionsMenu: Animate to beneath inventory view on Pause_Inventory?
- "Continue or Save & Quit?" GUI

- Difficult to fire wand through narrow passages

- Make the shield appear every time it deflects an attack?
- Don't use the same image for WoodenShield and MagicShield
- Hearts floating around in "Secret to everybody" cave that runs beneath fairy fountain

- No rolling rupee sound after "Secret to everybody" or door repair
- There should be an event sound when you present meat to "Grumble, grumble"
- Need event sound in "Pick any one you want" caves
- Wrong sound effect for both types of fairy (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhb3LqLtTBM @11:30)
- There should be a sound and gradual heart refill when using potion
- There should be a wizzrobe sound
- Should be event sound for riding raft
- Should be a roaring sound when in or next to a boss room


Low Priority:

- Lost Woods: Overriding directions doesn't work right for -x and -z;
- Beams from many dungeon enemies should be unblockable (Is this too difficult though?)
- Is it possible to "double collect" a Collectible by throwing the Boomerang and then walking into item as Bomerang returns?
- Dungeon tunnels have passages with zero-thickness walls
- Old men in dungeons don't fight me back
- Whistle Warp: Facing north or west, warp to the next dungeon; facing south or east, warp to the previous dungeon
- Whistle Warp: If he blows the Recorder multiple times while the whirlwind approaches, he can cycle through the sequence indefinitely. 
- Texture blocks correctly (use BoxMesh.cs?)
- Texture OW DungeonEntrances correctly?
- Hold up HeartContainer if received in Grotto
- LikeLike: Show an effect to indicate what's happening when player is trapped ("swallowed")
- ImageEffects on camera (bloom etc)?
- SoundFX DSP (ie. reverb in dungeons)
- Music Fade In/Out
- Trees and rocks are shorter than a full tile
- Consider having dark rooms show walls dimly like the original
- Being able to aim arrows upward is a nice touch, but it's annoying when I shoot the ground, so maybe downward arrows should instead go parallel to the ground, like beam sword or wand. 
- Increase maxLiveProjectiles for certain bosses?
- What's up with Manhandla projectiles/damage?
- Have Enemy's pushBack force applied in weapon's moveDirection. (Have all weapons/projectiles transform.forward point in their direction of travel.)
- I'm not sure darknuts are supposed to be hurt by fire, or gleeoks by the wand
- Leevers: Should not be harmful when burrowing 
- River Zora projectile should briefly hold position (~0.3 secs) before firing towards Link
- Pushable Blocks should reset when leaving DungeonRoom (and linked doors reseal)
- HUD Dungeon Map Triforce icon should flash Red/Blue, cycling every ~0.7 secs

- Refactor Spells/Buffs/Effects
- Refactor Grottos


WishList:

- Make Map display an arrow for Link instead of a square
- Place "signs" above Grottos indicating type
- Cannon Transportation for Grotto Warps
- SubDungeon Warps - Mirror effect
- Allow pushback force to send enemies flying upwards
- Show Shield, indicate MagicShield?
- When WandProjectile hits Link's shield you should see it reflect off 
- Particles for MagicSword, MagicBoomerang, SilverArrow
- Bow Crosshair
- Have enemies make some noise to alert you of their presence
- Have Statues charge up each shot with a sound effect so player knows when to dodge
- Navigatable Cheat Menu
- FlyMode Cheat

- Unlockable bonus Zelda remixes
- Unlockable Fan Art
- Unlockable Cheats


3rd-Person Camera Mode:

- Tracked head movement should not effect Link facing direction/position
- Change controls
- Decide how to move camera to follow Link
- Link Sprite
- Transition between Camera modes


BUGS:

* BUG: NewGameEntryData saving to wrong location (should be saving into ZeldaVR_Data folder)
- BUG: ZeldaVRSettings values dont persist when closing UnityEditor

- BUG: Keese in sub dungeon don't move
- BUG: Vire can jump through wall
- BUG: A Ghini somehow survived the death of its master (possibly spawned right as master died?)

- BUG: Dungeon 8 is visible from inside grotto to the south of it.
- BUG: Dungeon sealed door pushes player forward when it closes
- BUG: Enemies that spawn after clock has activated aren't paralyzed
- BUG: UI Views can get clipped if you are close to a wall (maybe use ImageEffects->ScreenOverlay?)
- BUG: If you have no ItemB equipped, and you collect an Active item, it correctly equips; however when subsequently viewing Inventory, the cursor has not been updated
- BUG: I died in Dungeon 1, and after respawning, all the keys and the Boomerang were collectible again.  
- BUG: No deflect sound when enemy boomerang hits Link's shield
- BUG: If you buy Red potion (instead of HeartContainer in special grotto) you can obtain the letter simply by using the red and blue potions.

- BUG: Unity crashed unexpectedly shortly after returning to OW after completing Dungeon 1


OPTIMIZATIONS:

- Only update HUD text when info changes (i.e. keys, bombs, rupees, level)


NEEDS TESTING:

- LikeLike MagicShield stealing
- Darknut shields against MagicWand (no flame)

* BUG: Sometimes dungeon doors don't reopen (Level 1 old man room, Level 3 Ladder room, etc) - FIXED


RESEARCH:

- Fairy: Changes move direction regularly (is this how fairy is supposed to move?)
- Boomerang: Should it hurt stunned enemies?
- Should letter still appear in inventory after its been used (assuming no potions in inventory)?

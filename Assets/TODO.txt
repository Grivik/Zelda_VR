-- BUGS --
- BUG: If you Pause during music opening, the loop won't play automatically when the opening finishes
- BUG: Moldorm looks crazy when resuming after pause
- BUG: Enemies can end up walking through walls in Lost Woods
- BUG: Enemies that spawn after clock has activated aren't paralyzed
- BUG: Vire can jump through wall
- BUG: Sword often malfunctions (either becomes invisible or gets "stuck", I'm not sure)
- BUG: Projectiles can't pass over water in OW
- BUG: ZeldaVRSettings values dont persist when closing UnityEditor
- BUG: UI Views can get clipped if you are close to a wall (maybe use ImageEffects->ScreenOverlay?)


-- Optimizations --
- Spawn LostWoods only when needed
- Only update HUD text when info changes (i.e. keys, bombs, rupees, level)


--- NEEDS TESTING  ---

- LikeLike MagicShield stealing
- Bait
- Darknut shields against MagicWand (no flame)
- Vires - No redKeese if MagicSword or magicSwordProjectile kills
- Wand Flame should light up dark room
- Playing flute, gameOver, or triforceFanfare should stop music


--- DONE ---

- DK2 Support
- Uniblocks voxel engine now used to render OverWorld terrain
- Shrunk PlayerController (scaled from 1 to 0.5)
- Fixed several major memory leaks that would eventually cause crash if left running for long enough.
- Allow both Keyboard/Mouse and XBOX GamePad to be used simultaneously

- Black overlay shutters now close vertically onDeath


--- NOTES ---

- Enemy Type Count:  
   Overworld - 4 small, 5 big.  
   Dungeon   - 5 small, 6 big.  
   Bosses    - 8
